The dataset consists of elements used to manufacture glass. The column 'Glass Type' consist of the class to which a glass belongs using different compositions of the elements. I'm using different standardization techniques here-StandardScaler,MinMaxScaler and RobustScaler, and plotting the graph to get the best value of 'k' with minimum error.
